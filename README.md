## Protein Identification False Discovery Rates
Mayu is a software package for the analysis of (large) mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics data sets. Mayu determines protein identification false discovery rates (protFDR), peptide identification false discovery rates (pepFDR) and peptide-spectrum match false discovery rates (mFDR) using a novel robust and fast strategy.
